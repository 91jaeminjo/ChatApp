# ChatApp

This is my backend implementation of a chat application in Java.

Users can send messages to everyone who is online in the chat application.
Users are prompted to enter their name, and their name will be associated with the message they send.

Future goals:
- Improve front end with a separate React application.
  - allow users to add friends.
  - enable separate chat rooms with their friends.
- Enable user Authentication with JWT, and/or OAUTH.
